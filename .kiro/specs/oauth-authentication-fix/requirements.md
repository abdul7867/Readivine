# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the post-OAuth authentication redirect loop issue occurring in the deployed MERN stack application. The problem manifests when users successfully authenticate via GitHub OAuth but the frontend fails to recognize the authenticated state, causing an infinite redirect loop between the login page and dashboard. This issue is specific to cross-domain deployments (Vercel frontend + Render backend) and involves cookie configuration, CORS settings, and authentication state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has successfully authenticated via GitHub OAuth, I want to be redirected to the dashboard without experiencing redirect loops, so that I can access the application's protected features immediately after authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes GitHub OAuth authorization THEN the backend SHALL set authentication cookies with proper cross-domain configuration
2. WHEN the backend redirects to the frontend dashboard THEN the frontend SHALL recognize the authenticated state from the cookie
3. WHEN the frontend checks authentication status THEN it SHALL not redirect authenticated users back to the login page
4. WHEN cookies are set by the backend THEN they SHALL be accessible by the frontend despite being on different domains

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer deploying to production, I want proper CORS configuration between my Vercel frontend and Render backend, so that authentication cookies and API requests work correctly across domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend sets CORS configuration THEN it SHALL allow credentials from the Vercel frontend domain
2. WHEN the frontend makes authenticated requests THEN the backend SHALL accept cookies from cross-origin requests
3. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL properly reference the correct production URLs
4. IF the frontend and backend are on different domains THEN CORS SHALL be configured to handle preflight requests correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user accessing the application, I want secure cookie handling that works in production environments, so that my authentication session is maintained properly and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication cookies are set THEN they SHALL use appropriate sameSite, secure, and domain attributes for cross-domain scenarios
2. WHEN cookies are configured THEN they SHALL be httpOnly for security while remaining accessible for authentication checks
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN cookie configuration SHALL work with HTTPS in production
4. IF cookies fail to be set or read THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want robust authentication state management in the frontend, so that authentication checks are reliable and don't cause redirect loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend checks authentication status THEN it SHALL handle both cookie-based and header-based authentication
2. WHEN authentication state is uncertain THEN the frontend SHALL make an explicit API call to verify status
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the frontend SHALL distinguish between "not authenticated" and "authentication error" states
4. WHEN the dashboard component mounts THEN it SHALL verify authentication before rendering protected content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for authentication issues, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve authentication problems in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log specific error details including cookie and CORS information
2. WHEN OAuth callback processing fails THEN the backend SHALL provide meaningful error responses
3. WHEN frontend authentication checks fail THEN they SHALL log the specific reason for failure
4. WHEN debugging authentication issues THEN developers SHALL have access to cookie and request debugging endpoints
