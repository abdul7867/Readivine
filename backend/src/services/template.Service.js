  description: 'A template for creating a stunning, visually-rich, and highly accurate README with a professional design.',
  prompt: `
    Generate a stunning, visually-rich, and highly accurate README.md file by performing a deep analysis of the provided project file structure. The final output must be a beautifully formatted, professional document that is as impressive as it is informative.

    **Step 1: Deep Analysis**
    First, thoroughly analyze the file paths to infer the project's type (e.g., Web App, API, Library), primary technologies, core features, and development tools (testing, Docker, etc.). This analysis will inform the content of every section.

    **Step 2: Construct a Visually-Rich Structure**
    Using your analysis, build the README with the following aesthetic structure. You must use Markdown and HTML tags where necessary to achieve the specified visual styling (e.g., for centering).

    - **Project Title:** A large, centered H1 heading for the project name.
      \`<h1 align="center">Project Title</h1>\`
    - **Tagline:** A centered, italicized, and concise tagline that captures the project's essence.
    - **Badges:** A centered collection of stylish badges (e.g., from shields.io). Include placeholders for Version, License, Build Status, and any relevant technologies.
